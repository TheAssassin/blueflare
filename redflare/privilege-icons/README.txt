These icons were made by Iceflower, a Red Eclipse community member.

The original icons can be found in the Red Eclipse community repository:
https://github.com/red-eclipse/community/tree/master/Iceflower

Adjustments: The black and white paths were differenced, the icons' borders
were removed. This was done using Inkscape.

The icons are licensed under "Red Eclipse General License" (that's what
